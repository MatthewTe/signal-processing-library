# Signal Processing Library
An unnecessary python library to implement various signal processing algorithms such as FFT. Not intended for any use other than educational due to its inferiority to other, better actual signal processing libraries. Seriously, use Librosa.

This library is an OOP wrapper for librosa and pyAudioAnalysis meant to represent an audio signal. It contains all of the methods in those libraries used to extract features from both the time and frequency domains.

**THIS IS A WRAPPER, A VERY BAD AND LAZY WRAPPER FOR MY OWN PROJECTS. IF FOR SOME REASON YOU WANT TO USE THIS THEN GOD HELP YOU PLEASE USE [THE pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis) LIBRARY INSTEAD.**
